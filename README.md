## Master's Thesis - Estimating House Prices through Machine Learning
 
  For my Master's thesis at the University of Mannheim, I used machine learning algorithms to predict house prices in Germany and compare the results with the traditional hedonic pricing model. In the first part, I used four machine learning algorithms to estimate the house prices (Kernel Ridge Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines and Neural Networks). For each of these models, I tuned the hyperparamters using Random Search. 
  In the second part, I used Stacked Generalization to develop an ensemble meta-learner on the basis of my four machine learning algorithms. After compring the results, I concluded that the stacked ML model performs better than the traditional hedonic pricing model.
